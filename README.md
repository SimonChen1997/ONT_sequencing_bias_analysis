# ONT sequencing bias analysis
This is a study to identify the sequencing biases of two Oxford Nanopore library preparation protocols, which are ligase-based and transposase-based. The study can be seperated into five sections üìù:


**Section 1Ô∏è‚É£: enzyme recognition motif identification:**

Scripts in the *enzymatic_motif* folder contains all codes for this analysis.
<br/><br/>

**Section 2Ô∏è‚É£: enzyme interaction and seqeuencing coverage bias:**

Scripts in the *interaction_sequencing_coverage* folder includes all codes for this analysis.
<br/><br/>

**Section 3Ô∏è‚É£: microbioal profile differences:**

Scripts in the *microbiome* folder contains all codes for this analysis.
<br/><br/>

**Section 4Ô∏è‚É£: bacterial DNA methylation profile divergence:**

Scripts in the *methylation* folder includes all codes for this analysis.
<br/><br/>

**Section 5Ô∏è‚É£: mock community profile divergence:**

Scripts in the *mock_community* folder includes all codes for this analysis.
<br/><br/>
